# Role Switching and Management Features

## Overview
This document outlines the new role selection and switching functionality implemented for the Music-U-Scheduler application.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Role Selection Page
- **Location**: `/role-selection/page.tsx`
- **Component**: `components/auth/role-selection.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Allows instructors with admin privileges to choose between admin and instructor dashboards

**Features:**
- Automatic detection of users with dual privileges (instructor + admin)
- Clean, user-friendly interface with role cards
- User information display
- Direct logout functionality
- Responsive design with smooth animations

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Logic
- **File**: `frontend/contexts/auth-context.tsx`
- **Enhancement**: Modified login flow to redirect users with multiple roles to the role selection page

**Logic:**
- Checks if user has both instructor role AND admin privileges
- Redirects to `/role-selection` if both conditions are met
- Otherwise, redirects to appropriate single dashboard

### 3. Role Switching in Dashboards

#### Admin Dashboard
- **File**: `app/components/admin/admin-dashboard.tsx`
- **Added**: Role switching dropdown in header
- **Features**: 
  - Switch to Instructor Dashboard
  - Return to Role Selection page
  - Only visible if user has instructor privileges

#### Instructor Dashboard
- **File**: `app/components/instructor/instructor-dashboard.tsx`
- **Added**: Role switching dropdown in header
- **Features**:
  - Switch to Admin Dashboard
  - Return to Role Selection page
  - Only visible if user has admin privileges

### 4. Role Management Delete Functionality
- **File**: `app/components/admin/role-management.tsx`
- **Status**: Already implemented ✅
- **Features**:
  - Delete custom roles with confirmation dialog
  - Prevents deletion of built-in roles
  - Proper error handling and success notifications

### 5. Type System Updates
- **File**: `app/lib/types.ts`
- **Added**: `assigned_roles` property to User interface
- **Purpose**: Support for users with multiple instructor roles and admin privileges

## How It Works

### For Instructors with Admin Privileges:
1. **Login**: User logs in with credentials
2. **Detection**: System detects user has both instructor role and admin privileges
3. **Role Selection**: User is redirected to role selection page
4. **Choice**: User chooses between Admin or Instructor dashboard
5. **Navigation**: User can switch roles anytime using the dropdown in dashboard headers

### Admin Privileges Detection:
Admin privileges are detected when a user has either:
- Primary role: `admin`
- OR assigned roles with `admin_access` permission

### Role Switching:
- Available in both Admin and Instructor dashboard headers
- Uses dropdown menu with intuitive icons
- Provides options to switch roles or return to role selection
- Only displays if user has multiple role capabilities

## UI/UX Improvements
- **Consistent Design**: Matches existing application theme
- **Intuitive Icons**: Clear visual indicators for different roles
- **Smooth Transitions**: Professional animations and state changes
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all device sizes
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for all actions

## Technical Implementation
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety for all new features
- **React Hooks**: Proper state management and lifecycle handling
- **Next.js Integration**: Server-side rendering compatible
- **Component Reusability**: Modular design for maintainability

## Testing Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Build process successful
- ✅ Component rendering verified
- ⚠️ Backend API integration pending (authentication endpoints need backend)

## Usage Examples

### Role Selection Page
```typescript
// Automatically shown for users with dual privileges
// Manual access via: /role-selection
```

### Dashboard Role Switching
```typescript
// Available in header dropdown for eligible users
// Immediate navigation to selected role dashboard
```

## Future Enhancements
1. **Role History**: Track user's role switching patterns
2. **Default Role**: Allow users to set preferred default role
3. **Session Persistence**: Remember last selected role across sessions
4. **Role Permissions**: More granular permission-based role detection

## Conclusion
The role switching functionality provides a seamless experience for users with multiple privileges while maintaining security and usability. The implementation follows React best practices and integrates well with the existing codebase.
