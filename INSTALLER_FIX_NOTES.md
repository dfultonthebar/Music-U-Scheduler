# Installer Fix - Frontend Setup Issue

## Issue Resolved
Fixed a critical issue in the installer where the frontend setup would fail with:
```
Error: EEXIST: file already exists, mkdir '/home/musicu/Music-U-Scheduler/frontend/node_modules'
```

## What Was Fixed
1. **Cleanup existing node_modules**: The installer now removes any existing `node_modules` directory before attempting to install dependencies
2. **Yarn cache cleaning**: Added yarn cache cleaning to prevent conflicts from previous installations
3. **NPM fallback**: If yarn install fails, the installer will automatically try npm as a fallback
4. **Network timeout**: Added 300-second timeout for slower internet connections
5. **Better error handling**: Improved error suppression and logging for build processes

## For Users Experiencing This Issue
If you encounter the EEXIST error during installation:

### Quick Fix
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd ~/Music-U-Scheduler/frontend

# Remove the problematic node_modules directory
rm -rf node_modules

# Clear yarn cache
yarn cache clean

# Try installation again
yarn install
```

### Full Reinstallation
```bash
# Remove the entire installation
rm -rf ~/Music-U-Scheduler

# Run the updated installer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfultonthebar/Music-U-Scheduler/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Technical Details
This issue typically occurred when:
- Previous installation attempts left corrupted `node_modules` directories
- Yarn lockfile conflicts existed
- Permission issues with existing dependency files
- Network interruptions during previous installations

The fix ensures a clean slate for each installation attempt while providing robust fallback mechanisms.
